# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [3.1.0]

### Added
- **Prompts** capability — 4 reusable pt-BR workflow templates: CEAPS expenses, bill tracking, senator votes, and an e-Cidadania overview.
- **Resources** capability — 5 static context docs: usage guide, tool catalog, glossary, and the tipos-matéria / UFs reference tables.
- `LICENSE` file (MIT).

## [3.0.0]

### Changed (BREAKING)
- Consolidated 90 → 65 tools by merging near-duplicate tools into enum parameters (e.g. reference tables → `senado_tabelas_referencia`; per-process sub-resources → `senado_processo_detalhe`; `senado_mesa` with a `casa` param; `senado_search_votacoes` absorbing the recent-votes/list tools). Several tool names were removed or renamed.

## [2.3.0]

### Added
- Every tool now declares MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `openWorldHint`) and a structured-output schema.

### Changed
- Canonical endpoint moved to the custom domain `https://senado.sidneybissoli.com/mcp` (the `*.workers.dev` URL still works as a fallback).

## [2.2.0]

### Added
- Administrative domain (groups O, P, Q, R — 16 tools) consuming `adm.senado.gov.br`. Large datasets (CEAPS ≈ 10 MB/year, payroll ≈ 5.5 MB/month) are fetched once, cached, and filtered/aggregated inside the Worker — tools never return raw dumps.

## [2.1.0]

### Changed
- Migrated all tools that consumed upstream-deprecated endpoints (the legacy `/materia/*` family and `/senador/{codigo}/votacoes`) to the v3 `/processo` and `/votacao` APIs, keeping tool names and output keys stable.
